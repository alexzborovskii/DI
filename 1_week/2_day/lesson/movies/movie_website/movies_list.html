            <h2>Love and death</h2>
            <p>Love and Death is a 1975 American comedy film written and directed by Woody Allen. 
                It is a satire on Russian literature starring Allen and Diane Keaton as Boris and Sonja, 
                Russians living during the Napoleonic Era who engage in mock-serious philosophical debates. 
                Allen considered it the funniest film he had made up until that point.</p>
